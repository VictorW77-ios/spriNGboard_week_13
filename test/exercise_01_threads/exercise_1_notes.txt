In `../../test__exercise_01_threads.cc`, what do you think it will output when run?
--> The first cout statement on L:17 will output first, the threads (t_1,t_2,t_3) will output next, followed by the final cout statement on L:25. 

Does the output match your expectations?
--> The output didn't match my initial expectations! There are 100 t_1 outputs (a), somes followed by t_2 (b), sometimes c or b are mixed in. 

What do you notice?
--> The output is all over the place and definately not following the events outlined by the code. In some executions, it doesn't even follow the t_1 (a) -> t_2 (b) -> t_3 (c) order. 

When execution reaches `LINE A`, how many threads are running?


Comment out one of the `join()` lines, recompile, and rerun the program.  What happened?  

Why?  


Run ls in the `./build` directory.  What are those new files?


Assuming that we donâ€™t care about the exact ordering of the letters, are there any problems with this code?
