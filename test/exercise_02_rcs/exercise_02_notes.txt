Why are counter and counter_mutex being passed by reference to the threads?
--> 'counter' and 'counter_mutex' are passed by ref because we want the program to modify the containers as they're being incremented. 

How long (approximately) will it take the test to run?  Will it pass?
--> The program should run in O(3*N) time for all 3 threads, where N < num_times (num_times = 1,000) + 1ms, given the sleep() func. 

Will it pass?
--> Unsure about this! I think it will pass but I'm hesistant because the test case requires the counter == 3*num_times and I'm not sure how this'll translate with the exec running 3 threads separately at O(num_times), unless this issue is fixed by passing by reference and the counter's value ends up being 3*num_times. 

Do the outputs and times match your previous expectations?
--> Nope, but my expectations were somewhat correct. The test cases failed because the counter =/= 3*num_times. The times are interesting because the real time (0m1.077s) is higher than the user time (0m0.022s). Not to mention the sys time being 0m000s. 

Rebuild and rerun the code.  Does the test pass?

How long does it take to run?



Recompile and rerun the code.  Does the test pass?  

How long does it take to run?  


What does this say about which code should be inside critical sections?
