Are there any concurrency issues in this code?
--> Yes, both functions (increment_counter_ver_1 & increment_counter_ver_2) essentially do the same thing and lock the same mutexes. I also don't think they're being passed the right mutexes either (mutex_a vs mutex_x?)

From the ./build directory, run:
	./test/exercise_03_deadlock/test__exercise_03_deadlock
What happens?  
--> The program stalls and the test cases fail. 
Why?
--> The functions are locking the same mutexes, so ver_2 has to wait for ver_1 to unlock and release the mutexes to it. This causes the program to stall because it can't move forward (deadlock). 

Fix the code.
